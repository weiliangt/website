I graduated summa cum laude from Yale-NUS College in Singapore in 2018. I am extremely grateful to have had access to a leading liberal arts education with faculty from Yale and other leading US institutions at a highly affordable cost. 
<!-- Our common curriculum with courses in philosophy, history, literature and modern social thought helped develop writing. -->
At Yale-NUS I led the student environmental group. 

In Spring 2017, I was a visiting student at Yale University.
