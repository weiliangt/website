In July 2026, I will join [Claremont McKenna College](https://www.cmc.edu/robert-day-school/faculty-research/faculty-list) as an Assistant Professor of Economics. 
<br><br> I received my PhD in [Applied Economics from Cornell University](https://dyson.cornell.edu/) in 2025 and was a visiting student at the Department of [Economics at Yale University](https://economics.yale.edu/) from 2023-2025 hosted by [Prof. Samuel Kortum](https://campuspress.yale.edu/samuelkortum/).
<br><br> My primary fields are International and Spatial Economics; Urban Economics; and Innovation and Entrepreneurship. I leverage big data and quantitative spatial models to study the geography of innovation and entrepreneurship.
