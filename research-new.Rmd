# Working Papers

<left class="flex-container">
<left> <img src="YNC_2.jpg" style="width:100%"> </left>
<right> <font size="4">**Market Adaptation to Climate Change in Dynamic Spatial Equilibrium**</font>  
(with Ivan Rudik, Gary Lyn, Ariel Ortiz-Bobea)  
<br /> **Research Question**: What are the welfare effects of general equilibrium adaptation via trade, migration, and capital accumulation in response to climate change?  
<br /> **Methodological Contributions**: (1) Model-consistent estimating equations to identify climate impacts on productivity and amenities from temperature shocks; (2) Quantitative decomposition of general equilibrium adaptation channels (trade, migration, industry switching, capital accumulation) to shocks in fundamentals in a dynamic spatial model
